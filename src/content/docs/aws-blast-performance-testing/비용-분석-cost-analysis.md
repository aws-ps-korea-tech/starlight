## 6. Per-Sequence Cost Analysis

| Sequences | Total Cost* | Cost per 1,000 Seqs | EFS Read per Job |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 500 | $18.11 | $36.22 | ~400 GB |
| 5,000 | $18.22 | $3.64 | ~400 GB |
| 50,000 | $18.38 | $0.37 | ~400 GB |
| 500,000 | $20.87 | $0.04 | ~435 GB |

*Includes estimated EFS read costs (~$17.60 per job for ~409 GB average read)

### Key Insight
- **EFS throughput is the dominant cost** (89% of total)
- Each BLAST job reads ~400+ GB from EFS (database loading + search)
- EC2 compute cost is relatively small (6.6%)

## 7. Cost Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Optimizations

1. **EFS Throughput Mode**
   - Current: Elastic ($0.043/GB read)
   - Alternative: Provisioned Throughput
   - **Savings**: If consistent usage, provisioned may be cheaper

2. **Database Caching Strategy**
   - Use instance store or EBS for frequently accessed DB portions
   - Potential savings: 50-70% on EFS throughput

3. **Batch Job Consolidation**
   - Run multiple query files in single job
   - Amortize database loading cost across more sequences

### Long-term Optimizations

| Strategy | Potential Savings | Complexity |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Use Spot Instances | 60-80% on EC2 | Low |
| EBS-backed BLAST DB | 70%+ on storage I/O | Medium |
| Smaller instance types | Variable | Low |
| Reserved Instances | 30-50% on EC2 | Medium |

### Recommended Architecture for Production

```
                    +---------------------+
                    |   EBS Snapshot      |
                    |   (BLAST Database)  |
                    +----------+----------+
                               | Attach on launch
                               v
+-------------+    +---------------------+
| S3 (queries)|---→|  EC2 Spot Instance  |
+-------------+    |  + EBS Volume       |
                   |  (local DB copy)    |
                   +----------+----------+
                              |
                              v
                   +---------------------+
                   |   S3 (results)      |
                   +---------------------+
```

**Estimated savings with EBS**: $70+ per day (eliminating EFS throughput)

### Optimized Architecture (with EBS)

| Component | Monthly Cost | Assumptions |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| EBS Snapshot | $12.70 | 254 GB @ $0.05/GB |
